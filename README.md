# RayTracerProject
Working on ray tracing in my spare time :)


This ray tracing implementation is designed to be a laggier, better version of WebGL, and I would very much like any and all uses.
This java project is simply designed to be a simple workhorse ray tracing machine for my other projects. Free to use.
